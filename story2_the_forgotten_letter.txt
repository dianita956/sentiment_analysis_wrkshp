The letter had remained ignored at the bottom of Maria’s drawer for years. She had refused to open it, refused to acknowledge its existence.

It was from David. The name alone made her angry.

They had been inseparable once. His words had been adorable, his promises heartwarming. But in the end, it had all turned deceitful, betrayal hidden beneath beautiful lies.

She picked up the envelope, fingers trembling. The old wounds were painful, but something inside her needed closure.

As she read, her heart sank.

"I know I was wrong. I know I hurt you. But please believe me—I never meant to. I was scared, stupid, and I let you down. If you ever find it in your heart to forgive me, know that I will always be waiting, hoping that someday you might smile when you hear my name again.”

The anger was still there. The hurt hadn’t vanished. But as she placed the letter back in the drawer, a small part of her felt lighter.
