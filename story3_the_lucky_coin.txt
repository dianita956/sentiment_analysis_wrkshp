Oliver had always been fortunate. His charming smile, his optimistic nature—everything about him radiated luck.

So when he found the old coin on the sidewalk, it didn’t surprise him. “Fantastic,” he muttered, rubbing it between his fingers.

That night, everything went perfectly. He won a prize at work, his date with Sophia was amazing, and his favorite restaurant gave him a free dessert “just because.”

“Lucky coin,” he joked, flipping it in his hand.

But the next day, the luck continued—then intensified. The lottery ticket he had bought on a whim? A jackpot. The job interview he had barely prepared for? He was offered double the salary.

He should have been delighted, but something about it felt unnatural.

That night, he placed the coin on his bedside table and whispered, “Is this too good to be true?”

The coin gleamed under the moonlight, as if smirking.
